002. You can find help with installation by clicking the question signs, or by visiting the website: [termin-kalender.pro](https://termin-kalender.pro)
003. Using the Calendar: The calendar you see has categories at the top. You can change these categories to fit your needs. Click the "Home" button to return to the main website page. Click on an empty spot in the calendar to add a new event, or click on an existing date to open it. You can move dates around (except for repeating events) by dragging and dropping them.
004. Link to help
005. Adding a New Event: Click on an empty space in the calendar. A window should appear to let you create a new event. Change the "Schedule:" text to your event title. Choose the date and time for the event's start and end. Pick a category for the event (you can change these in the "easy Termin-Kalender" admin menu). Add the full address for the location if needed. Write any notes you want to include about the event. Add a detailed description of the event. (The PRO version lets you add even more custom fields to this form.)
006. Viewing Existing Events: Clicking on a date in the calendar shows you a read-only version of the event details, similar to what visitors will see. The location link will now open that address in Google Maps. If you're the admin or a privileged user (PRO version), you can click "Edit" or "Duplicate" the event. Visitors will only see a "Close" button.
007. Editing Events: Click "Edit" to make changes to an event. Click "Update" to save your changes. Click "Delete" to remove the event, or just close the window to leave it unchanged.
008. Categories: Remember, you can change the categories, including their colors and icons, to fit your needs. Click on the category list at the top of the calendar to go to the "easy Termin-Kalender" admin page for managing them.
009. Moving Events: You can move most calendar entries by dragging and dropping them. However, repeating events (available in the PRO version) cannot be moved.
010. Using Gutenberg Blocks: Termin-Kalender works with Gutenberg blocks, the wordpress feature for building website pages. There are three blocks available: Calendar: This displays the calendar itself. Request Form (PRO): This lets visitors request appointments or make reservations. List Block (PRO): This shows a list of events or whatever you want to display, for a chosen category. Here's how to use the Request Form block: Choose a category for the request form. The request will appear on the calendar on the chosen date with that category label. You can create special categories for requests. Once you approve a request, just change the category label from "request" to the "approved" category you made. You'll also receive a copy of the email sent to the visitor.
011. PRO: The simple request form: This form allows visitors to request appointments, reservations, or other things you offer. Make sure to clearly explain what kind of requests this form is for above and around the block where visitors will see it. For example, you could say "Book a table for your next dinner party" or "Schedule a consultation".
012. 3 Gutenberg Blocks available. For the shared calendar and the Request and List form for the PRO calendars.
013. The list block (PRO) lets you create a list of events for a chosen category, like "Events," "Registration requests," or "Meetings."
014. Adding Pictures to Lists (PRO Feature updated: direct upload of pictures now possible)
